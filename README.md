# HTML Projects – Event Page & EMC Webpage

Welcome to the **HTML Projects** repository! 🎉  
This repository contains two complete HTML projects designed to help you understand the fundamentals of HTML step by step. Both projects will give you hands-on practice with essential HTML elements and page structuring.

## 📌 Project 1: Event Page (`event_page/`)

In the first project, I built an **Event Page** that covers the basic and most commonly used HTML components.  
You will learn how to use:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you’ll know how to structure a clean HTML page and create an appealing **Event Page**.

## 📌 Project 2: EMC Webpage (`emc_webpage/`)

The second project focuses on **Tables and Forms**, essential components in web development.  
You will learn how to use:

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

By the end of this project, you’ll be comfortable creating structured tables and interactive forms to collect user input.
